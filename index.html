title: Automation and Robotics In Reshaping The Workforce
---
<div class="blurb">
	
<!-- First body paragraph before What is Automation? -->
	<p>With the rapid growth of technology, it has now influenced different aspects of people's lives and various industries (Calimanu, 2023). Automation and robotics are just some of the many commonly used technologies nowadays, but they will be the focus of this discussion. So, what roles do they exactly play in reshaping the workforce?</p>
	<p>Before answering those questions, let us foremost know what automation and robotics are, as they are the center of the discourse.</p>

<!-- Advantages and Disadvantages in the Workforce -->
	<h1> Advantages and Disadvantages in the Workforce </h1>
	<p> From the examples provided above, we get a glimpse into how automation and robotics have significantly improved the way humans do things. The main goal of these innovations is to improve our quality of life by streamlining processes and making jobs easier and more efficient. At the same time, however, they also pose certain disadvantages which shows that they are not perfect systems. Below are some of the pros and cons of automation and robotics.</p>

<br> 
<h2 style="background-color: #437C75; color: white; padding: 10px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">ADVANTAGES</h2>
	<h3 style=color: green; padding: 10px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 20px;">Increased efficiency, productivity, and accuracy</h3>
	<p>Automation and robotics are used in different industries and operations today as they enhance productivity by increasing production output at a faster speed. By reducing manual labor, these automated systems also eliminate human error which leads to output that is standard and passes quality control.</p>

	</div>
	<h3 style=color: green; padding: 10px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 20px;">Cost-efficiency</h3>
	<p>Automation and robotics allow companies to save money by reducing labor costs and streamlining processes. With the need to hire human workers reduced, companies are able to allocate their resources more efficiently. Instead of having to pay employees' salaries, they can allot the budget into investments for additional hardware/software or upgrading them.</p>
<h3 style=color: green; padding: 10px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 20px;">Increased workplace safety</h3>
	<p>By reducing the need for manual labor, automation can reduce work-related injuries and accidents, especially in dangerous roles and/or in hazardous work environments.</p>
<div class="image-container">

		</div>
	</div>
	<p>One of the most common uses of robotics and automation in the industry is the use of heavy payload robots. These are pieces of machinery that can lift objects weighing over 200 kilograms. By utilizing these, human workers no longer need to manually perform the heavy lifting tasks which may result in physical injuries.</p>
	<h2 style="background-color: #8E2222; color: white; padding: 10px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">DISADVANTAGES</h2>
	<p>One of the major concerns that most people have against automation and robotics is that they are going to replace humans. A lot of movies associate these technologies with dystopian futures, further adding to the public's apprehension against them. Although we as a society haven't reached an alarming point technology-wise, we can't deny that we are beginning to see that this kind of fear has a certain validity to them. Below are examples of the disadvantages and limitations of automation and robotics.</p>
	<h3 style=color: #8E2222; padding: 10px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 20px;">Job displacement and unemployment</h3>
	<p>More and more companies utilize automation and robotics today, reducing the need for human workers. This can potentially lead to job loss and increase the unemployment rate. 
Let’s take a look at Jollibee, for example.  Since 2022, Jollibots have been in use in several stores nationwide. These adorable robots assist with bringing customers‘ orders directly to their tables. Once an order is ready to be dispatched, a crew member only needs to place the meal tray onto a Jollibot, and the robot will “look” for the correct table by scanning the area for the tracker that the customer was provided after they placed and paid for their order. Once the right table is identified, the Jollibot will approach it and the customer may then take their meal tray and return the tracker to the Jollibot.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<p>From a business perspective, Jollibots are a great innovation. Most of us have been to Jollibee during lunch or dinner rush and we’ve seen how chaotic it can be. With the use of Jollibots, dispatching orders is one of the repetitive tasks taken off service crew members’ hands, allowing them to do other tasks. Jollibots also reduce the risk of accidental spilling or dropping of food trays which can happen with manual food service. Jollibots help the company serve its customers more efficiently, but they also lead to a reduced need for staff members.</p>
	<h3 style=color: #8E2222; padding: 10px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 20px;">High implementation and maintenance costs</h3>
	<p>To reap the cost-efficiency benefits that automation and robotics provide in the long run, companies may need to shell out a huge amount of money to purchase automated systems and their software, as well as train their employees as they incorporate automation into their workflows. Automated systems also require regular maintenance to ensure smooth operation. In cases of technical failures, repair may also be costly.</p>
	<h3 style=color: #8E2222; padding: 10px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 20px;">Reduced human interaction and customer experience</h3>
	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rise of telemedicine and the use of other healthcare technologies. They have allowed patient care to be easier and virtually accessible.</p>

	</div>
	<p>While automation and robotics provide a certain level of efficiency, it can't replace some services that only the human touch can provide, such as empathy and complex decision-making. Some patients, especially older ones, may also be hesitant to use automated systems for lack of familiarity with new technology and may prefer talking to an actual human/doctor.</p>
	<h3 style=color: #8E2222; padding: 10px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 20px;">Skill loss and dependency to technology</h3>
	<p>People used to be able to perform arithmetic calculations manually or mentally with ease, but with the rise of computers/calculators, added with faster processing speed offered by automation, most of us are no longer able to do it as easily as we used to. Farming also used to be a much simpler task as everything used to be done manually. Robotics has definitely helped with agriculture, but it can also lead to humans forgetting how to plant and maintain crops without the aid of technology.</p>
	<p>As we replace repetitive, lower-skilled jobs, we also run the risk of losing human skills and expertise. Automation and robotics can result in humans being so reliant on technology that we forget or find it hard to perform certain tasks without automated systems.</p>
